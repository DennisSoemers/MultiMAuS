"""
This file provides a class that can be ''trained'' on training data, and then produce new
aggregate features for both training and test data. ''Training'' this class simply consists
of it memorizing various statistics.

Features constructed by this class are primarily inspired by:
"A data mining based system for credit-card fraud detection in e-tail", by
Nuno Carneiro, Gon√ßalo Figueira, Miguel Costa

Implementation is partially based on https://github.com/kb211/Fraud_Detection2017

        Paper has a ''TimeSinceFirstOrder'' feature in Table 1, with no further explanation in text. I suppose that
        this is an indication of how ''new'' the card is. Intuitively, a card which has been in use for a long time
        may be more trustworthy than a brand new card. So, I guess it could be a useful feature to add.

        It may be useful to add support for updating aggregate statistics with individual new transactions after
        first ''training'' it on a large training set. This could be used to update aggregate statitistics in real-
        time using transactions for which we obtain labels in real-time (transactions which are investigated
        by human experts for example)
