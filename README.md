# CredSim
Simulator for online credit card transactions with multi-step authentication

## Prerequisites
Python 3, mesa (use forked version from my github)

## 09-05-2017 NOTE from Dennis:
Created this branch so that I can safely mess around with different ways of communication between Java and Python, without messing anything up in master. 
This seems useful to me because, ultimately, I suspect I'll be interested in having my Java-based system receive data directly from the Python simulator
(and possibly also have the Python simulator respond to the behaviour of the Java-based system).
